# Deep-Learning-Project
Input: images from two famous monuments that are frequently confused: Cristo Rei (Portugal) and Cristo Redentor (Brazil). 

Objective: Construct a Deep Learning model that is able to correctly classify pictures from these two monuments as one or the other, recurring to Keras.

Given the nature of the problem – image classification – the type of deep learning model used for this task was Convolutional Neural Networks.
